# TrainScheduler

With this app you can enter train info, destination info, its first arrival time and the frequency of arrivals.
The app should keep all entered info and keep track of time.

It does not work entirely. Could not seem to get the moment.js code to work correctly and also have the Firebase info loaded correctly on the page.
